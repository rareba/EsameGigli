Pay attention to the feeling of your boots walking on the snow. Be aware of any ice that may cause you to slip.
Pay attention to the snowfall. Newly fallen snow is lighter than heavily packed or partially melted snow.
Notice your body. Are you cold?
Pick up the shovel. Space your hands out.
As you prepare to lift the snow, stand with your feet about shoulder width apart to maintain balance.
Bend at the knees, not the waist or back. Lift with your legs. Notice the tightening of your stomach muscles as you lift.
Exhale as you lift. Keep the shovel close to your body.
Take your time. Pace yourself. Enjoy the quiet moment and continue removing the snow, one shovelful at a time.
Focus your attention on your breath as it flows in and out of your body.
Stay in touch with the different sensations of each inhale and exhale without looking for anything special to happen — no need to alter or change your breathing, just observe.
